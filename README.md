# No More Nomads

## Introduction
This is one of my first forays into game development, and is a joint project building a platform puzzle game inspired by Lemmings. The end goal is to produce a lightweight item-based puzzle game with a wide variety of levels

##Basic information
* This is planned to be a 2D sidescrolling puzzle platformer built in Unity 2019.4.11f1
* All code is currently written in C#.
* The repo includes all images and animations used for the project

## Current State
* The game is in early design and PoC stage, with intention to develop it forward into something of note. 
* Currently all image assets are sourced from Kenney Vleugels (www.kenney.nl). This is a temporary measure, but it's amazingly nice of them to grant use for personal and commercial projects. 
* As this is early stages, almost all functionality is likely to change.
